# My first React.JS Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I used OpenWeatherApi for fetching the data , tailwind.css for styling .

It helped me a lot for learning to request data from an Api , I also made it responsive.

Hope you like it !
