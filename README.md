# My first React.JS Project

I used OpenWeatherApi for fetching the data , tailwind.css for styling .

I created an auto-complete search bar functionnality from the French "government API Adresse" .It was a really fun thing to do and I learnt to Fetch data , acces JSON answer and use UseEffect/UseState.

It helped me a lot for learning to request data from an Api , I also made it responsive.

Hope you like it !
